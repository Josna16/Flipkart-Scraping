I have come up with something good\"_ (Or perhaps the first one after i learned markdown)<br>In school usually we start learning to write using a pencil instead of a pen,hoping one day we would be good enough for the teacher to think that we are ready for pens.Similarly I have started with a pencil,waiting for me to learn from many mistakes yet to come which would make me stronger to make the perfect notebooks.<br>I have started with a fairly simple code for [**web scraping**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping).\n",
